        zucchini, and kimchi.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>First beat the eggs, and spread the eggs around the pan. When fully cooked, gently fold the egg omlette and
            slice it thinly. </li>
        <li>Then slice the zucchini and carrot. Fry both on the pan until it is lighly cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and soy sauce into a soup pot. Put the soup stock into it and boil it thoroughly until it
            reaches 140 F.</li>
        <li>Boil the flour noodles separately. After it is soft, pour out the hot water, and run the noodles under cold
            water. </li>
        <li>Then your done! Put the noodles on a bowl with the zucchini and carrot on top. Then, pour the hot broth on
            top of the noodles and you're done! It is best to enjoy the noodles hot before it gets soggy.</li>
        <li>If there are leftovers, it is best to throw it away as the food does not taste good when it gets cold and
            soggy, so make sure not to make too much noodles. Don't waste food! </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Recipe Website</h3>
    <a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-noodle-soup-janchi-guksu/">Website 1</a>
    <p>I used this site as a reference for my ingredients and instructions. It is very descriptive and easy to navigate,
        making this website very effective at teaching people how to make this dish. The website also gives an
        alternative recipe for those who may dislike the orginial toppings which is think is another plus.</p>
    <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/guksu">Website 2</a>
    <p>This is another website which I think did well in giving out the ingredients. It has a better instruction into
        teachigbn how to make the dish with videos attatched to it. The only problem is that it is full of ads, making
        it very slow to navigate across the website. </p>
    <a href="https://www.sweetandsavorhie.com/home/2020/1/27/janchi-guksu-korean-banquet-noodles">Website 3</a>
    <p>I think this website has the best design and layout. The image, font style, and the organization of the images
        and text makes it very easy to read. There is also very few ads in this website, making it a great website to
        see the brief content on this dish.</p>
    <h3>Non-Recipe Website</h3>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Website 1</a>
    <p>I really like w3schools' format. It is very easy to navigate because of the header. You can simply click on the
        things that you want to learn about more, and I think this is the design I want to incorporate for all of my
        websites so that it gives a better user experience when they navigate through my website. </p>
    <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/">Website 2</a>
    <p>Although the website might be confusing to navigate at first, the amount of design that is put into this website
        is very astonishing. There are bunch of short clips of different maps and characters, and there are many
        interfaces the user can interact, making the website very explorative and fun to explore. </p>
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Website 3</a>
    <p>I believe this website is the best at attracting the users. The design is very simple yet effective. It know how
        to communicate with the users by putting the most relevant game and topic at the top of the page. This is
        something I definetly want to put because attracting new users into their website is effectively the main goal
        for
        all companies.</p>
