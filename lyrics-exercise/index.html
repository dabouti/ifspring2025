            <br>
            <br>
            I wasn't jealous before we met
            <br>
            Now every woman I see is a potential threat
            <br>
            And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
            <br>
            You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
        </div>

        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Pre-Chorus]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            But now it isn't true
            <br>
            Now everything is new
            <br>
            And all I've learned has overturned
            <br>
            I beg of you
        </div>

        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Chorus]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Verse 2]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            It was like shooting a sitting duck
            <br>
            A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
            <br>
            I still don't know what you've done with me
            <br>
            A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Pre-Chorus]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I feel a kind of fear
            <br>
            When I don't have you near
            <br>
            Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
            <br>
            I beg you, dear
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Chorus]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
            <br>
            Don't go sharing your devotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
        </div>
        <div>

            <br>
            <br>
            I've had a few little love affairs
            <br>
            They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
            <br>
            I used to think that was sensible
            <br>
            It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Pre-Chorus]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            'Cause everything is new
            <br>
            And everything is you
            <br>
            And all I've learned has overturned
            <br>
            What can I do?
        </div>
        <div>
            <span class='versetitle'>[Chorus]</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
            <br>
            Don't go sharing your devotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
            <br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
            <br>
            Don't go sharing your devotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
            <br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion
            <br>
            Lay all your love on me
